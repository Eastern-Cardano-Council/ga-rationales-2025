## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “gov_action13836fuy3yttxn4hkeqka398q9qnwsjtmul4sxc3nht7qae8uvejsqm7ukh8” and title “Cardano in Oceania: A community-led strategic plan for investing in growth”, as a budget Info governance action, designates “selfdriven Services” as the administrator responsible for overseeing the use of funds and specifies a process for overseeing the use of funds from the Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
