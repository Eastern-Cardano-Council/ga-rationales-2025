## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “gov_action1u4jrcvlkppjzuv5j9z5ksacwtvv77h6glu0knpcjut8gvjjfu0cqqt3alsy” and title "Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget", complies with this requirement by naming a 9 member "interim administrating committee" as the responsible budget administrator, and establishing an oversight structure involving a treasury DAO (tDAO) composed of registered DReps tasked with validating milestones and auditing performance.

These elements demonstrate a defined, multi-layered oversight process for fund usage. The presence of both designated administrators and a representative community oversight body strengthens alignment with the Constitution’s transparency and accountability principles.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
