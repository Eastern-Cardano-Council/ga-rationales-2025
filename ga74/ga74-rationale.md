## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “gov_action1x2zm0lgd59kjrc9clzgscdlh0ct62l8llr638h6t4a5jj4yqzzyqq2dgc7q” and title "Reimburse Ikigai Info Governance Action Deposit.”, as a budget Info governance action, nominates the DReps as the administrator responsible for overseeing the use of funds, as “they will be responsible for executing the distribution.”

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
