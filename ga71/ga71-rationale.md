## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “gov_action16f69yf2f35w9ds8sr05ewyr55jg5f439mu8882rv295fvf8m4kcqql7y6nc” and title "Constitutional Committee Compensation Epochs 581-653” complies with this requirement by clearly defining a decentralized administrative and oversight framework through a customized version of the open-source Cardano Treasury/Vendor Smart Contract developed by Intersect and Sundae Labs.

Under this framework, each CC member is assigned an individual smart contract as administrator, ensuring separate accounting and transparent fund control. Each contract is funded only through a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action jointly approved by all compensated members, enables periodic withdrawals proportional to actual service time, and is auditable by peer CC members, who may pause payments if service ceases. Unclaimed funds automatically return to the Treasury after the compensation term.

This framework establishes a defined, self-enforcing, and verifiable process for Treasury fund oversight, thereby fulfilling the constitutional requirement set forth in Article IV, Section 2, and aligning with the broader constitutional principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
