## Summary
We have determined that this budget Info governance action is constitutional.

## Rationale Statement
Article IV, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states "Cardano Blockchain budgets shall specify a process for overseeing use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals including designating one or more administrators who shall be responsible for such oversight."

The governance action with ID “gov_action1jr84r96lnsvu9yd6c0jhxe9gj5r7vnd2pgkntc6klplxdpyzz4tqqc9uldx” and title “Budget: ₳5M Loan for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek”, as a budget Info governance action, designates “Intersect” as the administrator responsible for overseeing the use of funds and specifies a process for overseeing the use of funds from the Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals, including oversight by a “Board of Advisors”.

We therefore find this governance action **Constitutional**.
